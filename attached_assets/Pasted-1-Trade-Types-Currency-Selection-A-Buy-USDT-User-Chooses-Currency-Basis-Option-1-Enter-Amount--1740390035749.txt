1. Trade Types & Currency Selection
A. Buy USDT
User Chooses Currency Basis

Option 1: Enter Amount in USDT
The user inputs how many USDT they want to buy (e.g., 100 USDT).
The system calculates the corresponding amount in JOD based on the current exchange rate (plus any fees/commissions you may add later).
Option 2: Enter Amount in JOD
The user inputs how many JOD they want to spend (e.g., 100 JOD).
The system calculates how many USDT they will receive.
User’s Payment Method (for JOD)

The user is going to transfer JOD to your predefined payment options (CliQ alias or mobile wallet).
The user must have already set their USDT address (either Tron network or BEP20) in their profile/dashboard. This address will be used by the admin to manually send USDT after confirming the user’s JOD payment.
Order Creation

Once the user clicks “Submit” or “Create Order,” a transaction is created in the database with status Pending (or Awaiting Payment).
The admin sees the new transaction in the admin dashboard with all relevant details:
User’s chosen payment method (CliQ, wallet, etc.).
The user’s USDT address.
The amount of USDT or JOD.
The calculated equivalent amount.
The user sees the payment instructions (e.g., “Send 100 JOD to [CliQ alias or mobile number]”).
Payment Confirmation

The user manually completes the transfer outside the platform.
The user clicks a “Mark as Paid” or “I’ve Paid” button in the dashboard.
The admin receives a notification that the user claims to have paid.
The admin checks the payment receipt or bank account/wallet. If confirmed:
The admin updates the order status to Processing or Completed.
The admin manually sends the USDT to the user’s USDT address on Tron or BEP20.
The final status is set to Completed.
B. Sell USDT
User Chooses Currency Basis

Option 1: Enter Amount in USDT
The user inputs how many USDT they want to sell (e.g., 100 USDT).
The system calculates how much JOD they will receive.
Option 2: Enter Amount in JOD
The user inputs how much JOD they want to receive (e.g., 100 JOD).
The system calculates how many USDT they must send.
User’s Payment Method (for JOD)

The user must have already set their JOD receiving details in their profile/dashboard:
CliQ alias
Or mobile wallet number
During the Sell transaction, the user sees your USDT address (Tron or BEP20) so they can send the USDT to you.
Order Creation

The user clicks “Submit” or “Create Order,” creating a transaction with status Pending (or Awaiting USDT).
The admin sees the new transaction with:
The user’s chosen receiving method for JOD.
The user’s total USDT to send or the JOD amount requested.
Your own USDT address (shown to the user).
Payment Confirmation

The user sends the USDT to your address.
The user then clicks a button like “I’ve Sent USDT.”
The admin checks the wallet to confirm the USDT was received.
Once confirmed, the admin manually sends JOD to the user’s CliQ alias or mobile wallet.
The admin updates the transaction to Completed.
2. Admin Controls for Payment Details
Editable Payment Info:
In the Admin Panel, you want a section where the admin can modify or update:

Our JOD receiving details (e.g., different bank accounts, CliQ aliases, mobile wallet numbers).
Our USDT address (for Sell orders), if needed.
Transaction Overview:

The Admin Dashboard should list all orders (Buy/Sell) with real-time statuses.
Admin can filter by Pending, Processing, Completed, or Canceled.
3. Commission or Fee Handling
You mentioned you’ll “put the commission for buying or selling USDT later.”
The system should ideally have a fee configuration so that when a user enters an amount, the final cost or final receive amount automatically includes the fee.
Example: If the user wants to buy 100 USDT and the fee is 2%, the system shows them the total cost in JOD including that 2% commission.
