I'm facing an issue with the CliQ phone number not appearing in sell order transactions. When a user selects the "CliQ phone number" option in their settings and then places a sell order, the transaction’s cliqNumber remains null. Here’s what I need you to do:

Session Refresh After Updating CliQ Settings:
In the /api/user/settings/cliq route, after calling await storage.updateUserCliq(req.user.id, data), we fetch the updated user and then call req.login(updatedUser, callback).
Please ensure that this process correctly refreshes the session so that req.user immediately reflects the new data (especially the updated cliqNumber when the user selects the "number" option).
Add logging (or verify existing logs) to confirm that after updating, req.user.cliqNumber is correctly set.
Trade Endpoint Verification:
In the /api/trade route, we rely on req.user to obtain the user's CliQ settings.
Confirm that when processing a sell order, if req.user.cliqType === "number", the cliqNumber is not null and is correctly assigned into the transaction data.
Please add or verify debugging logs to ensure the user session contains the updated phone number before the trade is created.
Data Flow & Storage Checks:
Review the storage.updateUserCliq method to make sure it correctly updates the user’s cliqNumber in the database.
Confirm that storage.getUser(id) (used in both Passport’s deserializeUser and in the /api/user/settings/cliq route) returns the updated data.
Ensure Consistency Between Session and Trade Data:
Make sure that no stale session data is being used in the /api/trade endpoint. The user data fetched from the session should always reflect the latest updates.
Please update or adjust the session refresh logic and/or the storage methods as needed so that when a user selects the "CliQ phone number" option, the updated phone number is correctly propagated into req.user and then used in creating trade transactions.

Let me know if you need any further details or logs from the current implementation.
